        is where it all began. It was our first attempt to design and produce one
        of our ideas for a film. Having done the shooting, we were not happy with
        the result and so we had to scrap the initial idea and start all over. We
        experimented and improvised with the music, the editing and the graphics until
        we felt we had something. Having no expectations, we posted it on vimeo. The
        feedback was quick and overwhelming. People\u2019s comments from around the
        world, gave us the motivation to continue with more films for the series.\n\nhttp:\/\/deepgreensea.net\/projects\/the-carpenter.html\n\ndirected
